# MeetYou Dating App Feature 

MeetYou is a Dating App that was made by myself for Blok Tech. The feature i made is about the onboarding process of a user. It contains a step by step process of filling in information about yourself and answering questions. This way you can be matched with people who have the same interests and goals. The application is made with [NodeJS](https://expressjs.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [EJS](https://ejs.co/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

**When i** made an account on the website **i want** to be able to tell more about myself, interests and goals **so i can** only be matched with new people who have the same interests/goals.
